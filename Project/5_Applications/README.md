### Water Utilities

Water suppliers and utilities need to ensure the supply of the high purity water that the consumers can use for drinking and other purposes. 
By implementing this project, the utilities can monitor the quality of the distributed water in overhead tanks and even in pipelines. 

### Agriculture:

Optimum water quality is a pre-requisite for high yield of crop production. Based on the crop to be cultivated, the sensors and probes can be used to identify impurities that can hamper its growth. This will help farmers to enhance their irrigation practices and ensure a high yield of healthy crops.

### Manufacturing Units:

Production and manufacturing-based companies often discharge chemicals and other harmful fluids in rivers. Strict regulations are hence imposed on them to make sure that no harm is made to the aquatic life. Factories can hence use real-time water purity system to make sure that compliance is conformed as per the imposed regulations.

### Aquaculture

Aquaculture refers to the breeding of aquatic organisms like fishes, under a controlled environment. Purity of water plays an essential role in facilitating the growth of healthy fishes and crustaceans in large numbers so that they can be used as a livestock. 

### Wastewater Treatment

Wastewater generated is to be treated and managed before it is discharged into a freshwater body. Parameters like temperature, turbidity, and TDS are hence to be monitored to make sure that the water is treated properly before it is secreted. Smart water quality monitoring system using IoT optimize the inspection processes and hence reduce the need for manual interference.
