Components description:

Microcontroller: This is the CPU (central processing unit) of our project. We are going to use a microcontroller of 8051 family.

LCD:This section is basically meant to show up the status of the project. This project makes use of Liquid Crystal Display to display / prompt for necessary information.

Touch screen: User will enter the password using the keypad.

GSM modem: which is used to send alert message to the autority persons.

Components description:
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications): In this system using the GSM modem when some accidents or robberies is happen, then it will send the message to according to Bank authority and near police station (PS) corresponding to the controller.

MEMS Sensor(Micro Electro Mechanical Systems): This is the input functional block which is used to identify the tilts that are occurred in the ATM machine when a thief tries to break open the ATM machine.

Motor: Motor is used for closing the door when thieves are entering door will be closed automatically by using DC motor.

MAX 232: It is serial line driver used to establish communication between microcontroller and PC (or smart card reader).

LCD: This section is basically meant to show up the status of the project. This project makes use of Liquid Crystal Display to display / prompt for necessary information.

ADC 0804 Section: The ADC0808 data acquisition component is a monolithic CMOS device with an 8-bit analog-to-digital converter, 8-channel multiplexer and microprocessor compatible control logic. The 8-bit A/D converter uses successive approximation as the conversion technique. The converter features a high impedance chopper stabilized comparator, a 256R voltage divider with analog switch tree and a successive approximation register. The 8-channel multiplexer can directly access any of 8-single-ended analog signals. The device eliminates the need for external zero and full-scale adjustments.

Relay Section: A relay is an electrical switch that opens and closes under the control of another electrical circuit. In the original form, the switch is operated by an electromagnet to open or close one or many sets of contacts. A relay is able to control an output circuit of higher power than the input circuit, it can be considered to be, in a broad sense, a form of an electrical amplifier.
